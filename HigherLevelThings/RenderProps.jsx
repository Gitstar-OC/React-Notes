/* Render props is a pattern in React that allows you to share code between components by using
 a prop that is a function. This function is used to determine how the data should be displayed in the component.

 Let's say we have a restaurant called Little Lemon, and they want to display the number of desserts and drinks
 available on their menu. They need to fetch this data from a server before they can show it.

 To use render props, we create a component called `DataFetcher` that is responsible for fetching the data
 from the server. This component has a prop called `render` which is a function that defines how to display the data.

 For example, we can create two components: `DessertsCount` and `DrinksCount`. Each of these components
 will use the `DataFetcher` component and pass a function to the `render` prop to display the data in different ways.
*/

// Here's what the `DataFetcher` component might look like:

import { useEffect, useState } from "react";


function DataFetcher({ url, render }) {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Fetch the data from the server
    fetch(url)
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => setData(data));
  }, [url]);

  // Call the render function with the fetched data
  return render(data);
}

// And here's how we might use it in the `DessertsCount` component:
function DessertsCount() {
  return (
    <DataFetcher
      url="/api/desserts"
      render={data => (
        <p>Number of desserts available: {data ? data.length : 'Loading...'}</p>
      )}
    />
  );
}

// Similarly, for the `DrinksCount` component:
function DrinksCount() {
  return (
    <DataFetcher
      url="/api/drinks"
      render={data => (
        <h1>Number of drinks available: {data ? data.length : 'Loading...'}</h1>
      )}
    />
  );
}

// Finally, in our main `App` component, we can render both `DessertsCount` and `DrinksCount` to display the data on the screen:
function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
        <header className="Header"> Little Lemon Restaurant </header>
      <DessertsCount />
      <DrinksCount />
    </div>
  );
}

// With render props, we've created reusable components for fetching and displaying data,
//without having to write the fetching logic multiple times. We've also kept our components
// flexible by allowing them to define how the data should be displayed.

const DataFetcher = ({ url, render }) => {
  const [data, setData] = useState([]);

  useEffect => (() => {
    if (url.includes("desserts")) {
        setData(["cake", "ice cream", "pie", "donut"]);
    } else {
        setData(["coffee", "tea", "juice", "water"]);
    }

  }, []);

  return render(data);
};

/* The first DataFetcher function is fetching data from a server using the fetch API and updating
 the data state with the response. It takes a url prop to determine where to fetch the data from,
  and a render prop that is a function to render the fetched data.

 The second DataFetcher function, on the other hand, is not actually fetching data from a server.
 Instead, it's using a hardcoded condition to set the data state based on whether the url prop
 includes the string "desserts" or not. It still takes a render prop to render the data, but the
 data is not dynamically fetched from an external source.

// Solution to exercise: Implementing scroller position with render props
import { useEffect, useState } from "react";

const MousePosition = ({ render }) => {
  const [mousePosition, setMousePosition] = useState({
    x: 0,
    y: 0,
  });

  useEffect(() => {
    const handleMousePositionChange = (e) => {
      setMousePosition({
        x: e.clientX,
        y: e.clientY,
      });
    };

    window.addEventListener("mousemove", handleMousePositionChange);

    return () => {
      window.removeEventListener("mousemove", handleMousePositionChange);
    };
  }, []);

  return render({ mousePosition });
};

const PanelMouseLogger = () => {
  return (
    <div className="BasicTracker">
      <p>Mouse position:</p>
      <MousePosition
        render={({ mousePosition }) => (
          <div className="Row">
            <span>x: {mousePosition.x}</span>
            <span>y: {mousePosition.y}</span>
          </div>
        )}
      />
    </div>
  );
};

const PointMouseLogger = () => {
  return (
    <MousePosition
      render={({ mousePosition }) => (
        <p>
          ({mousePosition.x}, {mousePosition.y})
        </p>
      )}
    />
  );
};

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <header className="Header">Little Lemon Restaurant üçï</header>
      <PanelMouseLogger />
      <PointMouseLogger />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;

/* 1. Implement the body of handleMousePositionChange
 The mousemove handler function receives an event as parameter that contains the mouse
 coordinates as clientX and clientY properties. Therefore you can provide a position
 update by calling the state setter setMousePosition with the new values.
2. Implement the return statement of the component
  The MousePosition component receives a render prop, which is the special prop name designed
  by convention to specify a function that returns some JSX. Since the MousePosition component
  does not take care of any visualization logic, but rather encapsulates cross-cutting concerns,
  it should return the result of calling the render function with the mousePosition as an argument.
  In other words, it‚Äôs up to the components that consume MousePosition to specify what sort of UI
  they want to display when they receive a new value of the mouse position on the screen.
3. Step 2
  The PanelMouseLogger component should not receive any props. Hence, the early return from the previous
  implementation if no props were provided is no longer needed.
  Instead, the mousePosition is now injected as the first argument of the render function prop
  that MousePosition uses. It‚Äôs in this render function body where the previous JSX should be
  extracted and returned.
  At this point, the implementation has been completed and you should see the following result when you run the app in the browser:
